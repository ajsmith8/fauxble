	<div class ="paragraphs"></br>Join the <span>fuseGap</span> community and make society more informed by helping us collectively learn 1,000,000 facts.  If you and a friend each learn 10 facts, we collectively just learned 20 facts.  Once that number hits <span>1,000,000</span> (and hopefully a lot more), Americans might actually start knowing what's going on!  Let your <span>voice</span> be heard?  How about let your <span>facts</span> be heard.
</br></br>	
It's easier now than ever before to get informed, yet still society is pervasively ignorant about even the basic facts.  fuseGap is trying to make it cool to be informed--we envision a future where people take pride in their <span>knowledge</span>, NOT in their <span>ignorance</span>.  Kind of like the Enlightenment part two...a return to reason.</div>

	<div class = "paragraphs"></br>We're not <span>liberal</span>, we're not <span>conservative</span>.  We are aggressively biased towards the <span>facts</span>.  When Mitt Romney's campaign pollster says something like 'We're not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers,' we get really, really upset.
</br></br>	
If you're tired of average Americans being destructively ignorant, this is your opportunity to take a stand and actually <span>make a difference</span>.  Want to get involved?  Sign up, check out the site, share some facts with your friends--facts are useless if nobody knows them.  Feedback is always welcome; we're currently beta testing.</div>
